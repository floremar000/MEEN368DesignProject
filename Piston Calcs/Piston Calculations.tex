	The gaskets exhibit no vertical forces on the wall. Only the horizontal force from the connected rod is considered.
	The gaskets are simply modeled as springs connecting the piston to either side of the wall. Since the gaskets must maintain connection to the piston chamber wall, small deflections and angles are assumed. Thus small angle approximations are made.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item $\theta$ is the angle the piston is rotated with respect to the vertical.
	\item $x$ is the displacement of the piston.
	\item $z_{G_1}$ is the vertical distance from the top of the piston head to the center of the top gasket.
	\item $z_{G_2}$ is the vertical distance from the top of the piston head to the center of the bottom gasket.
	\item $z_{CG}$ is the vertical distance from the top of the piston head to the center of mass.
	\item $h_h$ is the height of the piston head.
	\item $d_h$ is the diameter of the piston head.
	\item $h_t$ is the height of the piston tail.
	\item $d_t$ is the diameter of the piston tail.
	\item $d_{go}$ and $d_{gi}$ is the inner and outer diameters of the gaskets.
	\item $h_g$ is the gasket height.
	\item $\Delta t$ is the thickness of the gaskets, $\frac{d_{go}-d_{gi}}{2} $
	\end{itemize}
	First, the center of mass of the piston is calculated
	\begin{align}
		z_{CG} &= \frac{\frac{h_h}{2}d_h^2 h_h + (h_h+ \frac{h_t}{2}) d_t^2 h_t}{d_h^2 h_h + d_t^2 h_t }
	\end{align}
	
	The spring equation for the forces are written out.
	\begin{align}
		F_{G_{11}} &= k(x - (z_{CG}-z_{G_1}) \theta) \\
		F_{G_{12}} &= k(-x + (z_{CG}-z_{G_1}) \theta) \\
		F_{G_{21}} &= k(x - (z_{CG}-z_{G_2}) \theta) \\
		F_{G_{22}} &= k(-x + (z_{CG}-z_{G_2}) \theta) 
	\end{align}
	The moment and force equations are written out.
	\begin{align}
		F_R &= - F_{G_{11}} + F_{G_{12}} - F_{G_{21}} + F_{G_{22}}\\
		0 &= F_R (h_h + h_t - z_{CG}) + (F_{G_{12}} - F_{G_{11}})(z_{G_1} - z_{CG})+ (F_{G_{22}} - F_{G_{21}})(z_{G_2} - z_{CG})
	\end{align}
	Finally, x and theta are solved for.
	\begin{align}
	\alpha &= 2 h_{h} z_{CG} - h_{h} z_{G_1} - h_{h} z_{G_2} + 2 h_{t} z_{CG} - h_{t} z_{G_1} - h_{t} z_{G_2}\\
	\beta &= - 4 z_{CG}^{2} + 3 z_{CG} z_{G_1} + 3 z_{CG} z_{G_2} - z_{G_1}^{2} - z_{G_2}^{2}\\
		x &= \frac{F_{R} \left(\alpha +\beta\right)}{2 k \left(z_{G_1}^{2} - 2 z_{G_1} z_{G_2} + z_{G_2}^{2}\right)}\\
		\theta &= \frac{F_{R} \left(2 h_{h} + 2 h_{t} - 4 z_{CG} + z_{G_1} + z_{G_2}\right)}{2 k \left(z_{G_1}^{2} - 2 z_{G_1} z_{G_2} + z_{G_2}^{2}\right)}
	\end{align}
	The spring constant of the gaskets is derived in terms of material and geometric properties. To simplify calculation, the gasket will be treated as a flat area cross section.
	\begin{align}
		\epsilon &= \frac{\sigma}{E}\\
		\Delta t &= t \epsilon = \frac{Pt}{A_C E} \\
		A_C &= d_{go} h_g \\
		k &= \frac{P}{\Delta t} = \frac{d_{go} h_g E}{\Delta t}
	\end{align}
	\subsection*{Gasket Stresses and Pressures}
	The average pressure difference from the reaction forces is given below:
	\begin{align}
	 \Delta p_{G_X \text{avg}} &= \frac{F_{G_X}}{d_go h_g}
	\end{align}
	The minimum pressure which the gaskets must be fitted to is determined by the maximum pressure of the air $p_{AM}$ and the minimum change on pressure from the piston forces.
	\begin{align}
	p_{\text{fit}} &\geq p_{AM} - \frac{\text{min} \{ F_{G_X}, 0 \}}{d_{go} h_g}
	\end{align}
	The radial gasket stress is simply the pressure on the gasket. Since the gasket is thin walled, a constant radial stress is assumed.
	Since the gaskets are supported by the piston head, the tangential stress is derived using a thick walled pressure vessel equation, with a solid pressure vessel. Since the inner radius is 0, the resulting stresses are identical.
	\begin{align}
		\sigma_{gr} &= -p\\
		\sigma_{gt} &= -p
	\end{align}
	The pressures also attempts to push out the gasket. The push out stress is derived below. The shear force is given pressure acting on the area of the gasket directly exposed to the chamber.
	\begin{align}
	 V &= \frac{\pi}{4}(d_{go}^2-d_{h}^2) p\\
	 \tau_{\text{max}} &= \frac{3V}{2A} \\
	 \tau_{gp} &= \frac{3V}{2 h_g \pi \frac{d_h}{2} } = \frac{3 \pi (d_{go}^2-d_{h}^2) p}{4 h_g \pi d_h} 
	\end{align}
	Finally, friction creates a shear force on the gasket. Since the gasket reactions are equal and opposite, $p_{\text{avg}} = p_{\text{fit}}$.
	\begin{align}
		V &=  \mu p_{\text{avg}} A_o \\
		\tau_{\text{max}} &= \frac{3V}{2A_h} \\
		\tau_{f} &= \frac{3 \mu p_{\text{fit}} d_{go}^2}{d_h^2} 
	\end{align}
	The minimum and maximum of each gasket stress is tabulated below for fatigue analysis.
	\begin{align}
		\sigma_{gr\ \text{min}} &= \sigma_{gt\ \text{min}} = p_{\text{fit}} + \frac{\text{min} \{ F_{G_X}, 0 \}}{d_{go} h_g}\\
		\sigma_{gr\ \text{max}} &= \sigma_{gt\ \text{max}} = p_{\text{fit}} + \frac{\text{max} \{ F_{G_X}\}}{d_{go} h_g}\\
		\tau_{g\ \text{max}} &= \frac{3 \pi (d_{go}^2-d_{h}^2) p_{AM}}{4 h_g \pi d_h} - \frac{3 \mu p_{\text{fit}} d_{go}^2}{d_h^2}\\
		\tau_{g\  \text{min}} &= -\frac{3 \mu p_{\text{fit}} d_{go}^2}{d_h^2}
	\end{align}
