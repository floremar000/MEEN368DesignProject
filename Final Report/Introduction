Design Goals:
	When coming up with a piston-crankshaft design, we had several design constraints that had to be met. There were to be 6 cylinders with 
  a total volume of 3000 cubic centimeters between them. It uses a 4 stroke timing cycle and must provide at least 200 horsepower at a 
  maximum speed of 8000 RPM. Apart from these hard constraints, we were aiming to minimize weight and cost. Both the manufacturing and 
  cost of materials. We were aiming for a factor of safety of greater than 3 for all the components to ensure it would not fail even in the
  event of overloading it and a fatigue factor of safety of 1.5 to ensure the piston life accurately matches the fatigue life calculation. 
  We also aimed to model our combustion cycle with an Atkinson cycle instead of the standard otto or diesel cycle for reasons which will 
  be described later on.
